# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub! This guide provides a centralized resource for understanding our project management processes, especially designed to help new team members quickly onboard and navigate our comprehensive documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **lean, collaborative approach** to project management that emphasizes:

- **Customer-first mindset**: Every project prioritizes customer value and usability
- **Clear roles and ownership**: Each project has designated Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders with well-defined responsibilities
- **Milestone-based delivery**: Projects are broken into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular retrospectives and data-informed decision-making drive ongoing refinement
- **Psychological safety**: Open communication and blameless post-mortems foster a culture of learning

Our processes are designed to be lightweight yet comprehensive, covering the full project lifecycle from initial idea validation through deployment and continuous improvement.

## Key Workflows

OctoAcme's project management lifecycle consists of five key phases:

1. **Initiation**: Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a project charter
2. **Planning**: Break work into actionable tasks, estimate effort, and define success criteria
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Manage day-to-day delivery with clear workflows and quality gates
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy features safely with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Core Roles & Personas

OctoAcme projects involve several key roles working collaboratively:

- **Project Managers (PM)**: Coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Managers (PdM)**: Define outcomes, prioritize backlog, and measure success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and business context

## Communication Strategies

We maintain transparency and alignment through:

- Weekly syncs between PM and Product Managers
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery teams
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Structured risk escalation paths
- Regular demos and milestone reviews

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every stage of our process:

- Clear Definition of Done (DoD) for all work items
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with tests and security scanning
- Peer code reviews with PR approval requirements
- End-to-end smoke tests before releases
- Comprehensive risk management and rollback procedures
